# C/C++ Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the C/C++ Data Structures and Algorithms repository! Here, you'll find a collection of both concurrent and classic data structures and algorithm implementations in C and C++. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about fundamental data structures and algorithms or an experienced developer seeking efficient concurrent solutions, this repository has you covered.

## Key Features
- **Concurrent Data Structures**: Explore a range of concurrent data structures designed to handle multi-threaded and parallel programming scenarios efficiently.
- **Classic Algorithms**: Dive into well-known algorithms and their C/C++ implementations for tasks like sorting, searching, and graph processing.
- **Educational Resources**: We provide clear explanations and comments within the code to help learners understand the logic and functionality of each data structure and algorithm.
- **Performance and Optimization**: We focus on optimizing our code for both speed and memory efficiency, ensuring you get the best possible implementations.
- **Growing Collection**: This repository is continuously updated with new data structures and algorithms, so be sure to check back for the latest additions.
